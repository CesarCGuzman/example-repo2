# This is an example repo that displays some basic react #

I made this for my little brother <3

## If you want to read the code from start to finish: ##
- Start at **src/index.js**
    - This is the parent of all the components, basically where everything begins. Like one of those russian dolls with more dolls inside of them.
- Then move to **src/App.js**
    - This is the main component. This houses all the other components we made, like the BasicInfo and the Form.
- Then **src/components/Form.js**
    - This is where the form fields are
- Now move on to **src/models/Person.js**
    - This is the model we are using for our data
- Lastly we can look at **src/components/BasicInfo.js**
    - This renders each persons data in a div
